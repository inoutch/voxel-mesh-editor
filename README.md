# voxel-mesh-editor
This editor supports voxel-type mesh generation for video game development like minecraft.
The editor generates JSON format definitions of voxel type meshes in advance and uses them in the runtime of game. (API for runtime is in progress)

Voxel-type mesh generation has the following features:
- Removes unnecessary meshes that are not visible on the screen
- Rich graphic selection depending on the terrain
